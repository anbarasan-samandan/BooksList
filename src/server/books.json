It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study."

Their suppressed libido and Oedipus complex are areas Tamil writers generally dared not enter - at any rate in the 1960s, when they were written.The brilliant introvert Rajaraman is the quintessential good boy. The play of circumstances kindles oedipal fancies in him. The incandescent consummation with Sarada Mami is a catharsis. A rishi is born looking at the world with a disdain at once benignly distant and compellingly personal.Well-educated and well-employed Janaki lives under the protective cover of her paranoid, possessive, puritanical mother. Her healthy friendship with a collegemate of yesteryear promises liberation. Her short-lived taste of freedom is stamped out and she is sucked back into her mother's bizarre, overwhelming orbit."

What the CEO Really Wants from You addresses the one key question that is uppermost in the mind of any manager: What should he or she do to make the boss a partner rather than perceive the boss as an extractor of work or an adversary? As Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, points out in his foreword, partnerships with others, but above all, with your direct boss and organization, are more important than ever before. Few people are so well qualified as R. Gopalakrishnan to guide us on this journey. This is a book that will be of immense value to all managers, and one that just might evoke pragmatic answers to the question of what the CEO really expects from the team."

As chief of the country's defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is about science."
